# Type Bad Words

## For fun, and mischief!

In 2012 a court order forced The Department of Homeland Security release a list of words it uses to monitor social media networks. These words were described as "signs of terrorist or other threats against the United States," but many say the words are too ambiguous to effectively track anything.

I thought people should be able to see the words and decide for themselves if they're really that dangerous.

Here's a quick article if you want to learn more or see the entire list of words: [Dept. of Homeland Security Forced to Release List of Keywords Used to Monitor Social Networking Sites](https://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2012/05/26/department-of-homeland-security-forced-to-release-list-of-keywords-used-to-monitor-social-networking-sites/#55e3f082acd0)
