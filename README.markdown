# Type Bad Words

## For fun, and mischief!

In 2012 a court order forced The Department of Homeland Security release a list of words it uses to monitor social media networks. These words were described as "signs of terrorist or other threats against the United States," but many say the words are too ambiguous to effectively track anything.

I thought people should be able to see the words and decide for themselves if they're really that dangerous.

Anyway, score 10,000 points to reveal the 20 of Congress members who accepted the most PAC money in the 2018 cycle!
